# 🛠️Installation

## Prerequisites

Below table shows the recommended (tested) requirements of the computer for running this framework.

| Component | Recommended (Tested) |
|-----------|-------------|
|    CPU    |Intel Core i9|
|    GPU    |   RTX 3080  |
|     OS    | Ubuntu 22.04|
|   Python  |     >=3.8   |
|Nvidia Driver|   >=535   |

LeggedGym-Ex incoporates two simulators into one framework. One can choose either simulator to use, with each simulator requiring a seperate conda environment due to the limitation of python versions. Below is the recommended (tested) environment setting for two simulators:

| Component |  IsaacGym   |   Genesis   |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|  Python   |    3.8      |    >=3.10   |
|  Nvidia Driver |   535  |     535     |
|  PyTorch  | 2.4.1+cu121 | 2.8.0+cu126 |

## Direct Installation

### IsaacGym

```bash
# 1. Create a conda environment with python3.8
conda create -n lr_gym python=3.8
conda activate lr_gym
# 2. Install Pytorch
pip install torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# 3. Download IsaacGym Preview4 under /home/username
cd /home/username
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym-preview-4 \
    && tar -xf isaac-gym-preview-4 \
    && rm isaac-gym-preview-4
# Substitute np.float with np.float32 to resolve compatibility
find isaacgym/python -type f -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/np\.float/np.float32/g' {} +
# Install isaacgym in this environment
cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e . && cd ../..
# 4. Install LeggedGym-Ex with isaacgym
git clone https://github.com/lupinjia/LeggedGym-Ex.git
cd LeggedGym-Ex && pip install -e ".[isaacgym]"
# 5. Test the installation
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task=go2 --num_envs=100
```
If a window like below appears, the installation is successful.

```

### Genesis

```bash
# 1. Create a conda environment with python3.10
conda create -n lr_gen python=3.10
conda activate lr_gen
# 2. Install Pytorch
pip install torch==2.8.0 torchvision==0.23.0 torchaudio==2.8.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
# 3. Install LeggedGym-Ex with genesis
git clone https://github.com/lupinjia/LeggedGym-Ex.git
cd LeggedGym-Ex && pip install -e ".[genesis]"
# 4. Test the installation
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task=go2 --num_envs=100
```
If a window like below appears, the installation is successful.

```

Finally, you need to register a wandb account and set the environment variable:
```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

## Optional Installation

### Unitree Go2 Sim2Sim

Deploying the policy to another simulator can effectively test the robustness of the policy. Also, the code used for sim2sim can oftern be deployed directly to the real robot. To avoid potential collapse on the real robot, it's better to first test the deployment code in simulation. 

Since deployment codes are usually written in C++, a simulator which supports C++ interface is ideal. We offer a sim2sim framework in mujoco based on [unitree_sdk2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2), [unitree_mujoco](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco) and [LibTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

For the simulator, you can install [unitree_mujoco](https://github.com/lupinjia/unitree_mujoco) according to the instructions in README.md.

For the deployment code, you can refer to [go2_deploy](https://github.com/lupinjia/go2_deploy) and [go2_deploy_python](https://github.com/lupinjia/go2_deploy_python).

Below is the interface of unitree_mujoco. We have implemented depth image access and publication through dds.

### TRON1_PF Sim2Sim

For sim2sim of TRON1_PF, you can install [tron1-mujoco-sim](https://github.com/limxdynamics/tron1-mujoco-sim) and [tron1-rl-deploy-python](https://github.com/lupinjia/tron1-rl-deploy-python) provided by us.
