# 🧑‍🏫🧑‍🏫 Teacher-Student Framework

In [Walk These Ways](walk_these_ways.md), we know that through tuning robot behaviors, we can let a policy trained on flat ground traverse some difficult terrains (like small curbs and stairs). It indicates generalization ability of the policy since it has been only trained on flat ground and data concerning complex terrains are not included in the training dataet. However, to achieve better stability and traversability on complex terrains, training on terrains are inavoidable. But as introduced in [deploy_to_real_robot](https://genesis-lr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started/deploy_to_real_robot.html), just a simple network that gets robot state feedback of one time step is not enough. Actually, if you use RNN or stack observation of multiple time steps, the policy will gain better ability to adapt to terrains. However, we still need some mechanism to effectively extract key information from observation history and endow the policy with better understanding of the robot and the surrounding environment.

## Teacher-Student Framework

As one of the pioneer of RL-based control on legged robots, [RSL from ETH zurich](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) has proposed a series of works to push the limit of quadruped robots on complex terrains. The one introduced here is teacher-student framework.

Intuitively, we understand that with privilege information(base_lin_vel, friction_ratio, added_mass, base_com_bias e.t.c) the locomotion problem can be seen as MDP(Markov Decision Process) instead of POMDP(Partially Observable Markov Decision Process). The policy can find better solution with more useful information. However, in real world, privilege information is not observable. But instead, it can be estimated. **The key insight of teacher-student framework is that privilege information can be estimated from observation history.** The simplified diagram of teacher-student is shown as below, where $x_t$ is privileged information, $o_t^H=[o_t, o_{t-1},...,o_{t-H+1}]$ is observation history with length of H steps, $l_t$ is encoded latent vector from teacher encoder, $\hat{l}_t$ is predicted latent vector from student encoder, $a_t$ is the action, $s_t$ is the state of the environment, $\hat{V}_t$ is the estimated value from the critic.

```

The privilege encoder(or teacher encoder) encodes privilege information into latent space with the same dimension. The history encoder(or student encoder) infers latent vectors of privilege information from observation history. The policy observes current observation and latent vectors, and outputs actions. 

The original teacher-student framework is a two-stage training framework, where encoder and actor are coupled. The teacher encoder and teacher policy are trained in the first stage, and the student encoder and student policy are trained in the second stage. To simplify the training process, RMA$^2$ proposed to decouple the encoder and policy, only requiring training student encoder in the second stage. Furthermore, RLvRL$^3$ proposed to achieve one-stage training by concurrently conducting reinforcement learning and supervised learning. The above diagram is the same as the method of RLvRL.

## Implementation

We implement a one-stage teacher-student training framework based on RLvRL$^3$. The core modification compared to standard actor-critic is in `actor_critic_ts.py` and `ppo_ts.py`. In `actor_critic_ts.py`, we add privilege encoder and history encoder as neural network modules.

```python
# actor_critic_ts.py
        # Privilege encoder
        privilege_encoder_layers = []
        privilege_encoder_layers.append(
            nn.Linear(num_privilege_encoder_input, privilege_encoder_hidden_dims[0]))
        privilege_encoder_layers.append(activation)
        for l in range(len(privilege_encoder_hidden_dims)):
            if l == len(privilege_encoder_hidden_dims) - 1:
                privilege_encoder_layers.append(
                    nn.Linear(privilege_encoder_hidden_dims[l], num_latent_dims))
            else:
                privilege_encoder_layers.append(nn.Linear(
                    privilege_encoder_hidden_dims[l], privilege_encoder_hidden_dims[l + 1]))
                privilege_encoder_layers.append(activation)
        self.privilege_encoder = nn.Sequential(*privilege_encoder_layers)

        # History encoder
        self.history_encoder_type = history_encoder_type
        history_encoder_layers = []
        if history_encoder_type == "MLP":
            history_encoder_layers.append(
                nn.Linear(num_history_encoder_input, history_encoder_hidden_dims[0]))
            history_encoder_layers.append(activation)
            for l in range(len(history_encoder_hidden_dims)):
                if l == len(history_encoder_hidden_dims) - 1:
                    history_encoder_layers.append(
                        nn.Linear(history_encoder_hidden_dims[l], num_latent_dims))
                else:
                    history_encoder_layers.append(
                        nn.Linear(history_encoder_hidden_dims[l], history_encoder_hidden_dims[l + 1]))
                    history_encoder_layers.append(activation)
            self.history_encoder = nn.Sequential(*history_encoder_layers)
        elif history_encoder_type == "TCN":
            in_channels = 1
            for l in range(len(history_encoder_channel_dims)):
                out_channels = history_encoder_channel_dims[l]
                padding = history_encoder_dilation[l]*(kernel_size-1)// 2
                history_encoder_layers.append(
                    nn.Conv1d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size,
                              stride=history_encoder_stride[l],
                              padding=padding,
                              dilation=history_encoder_dilation[l])
                )
                in_channels = out_channels
                num_history_encoder_input = (num_history_encoder_input - 1) // history_encoder_stride[l] + 1
            history_encoder_output_layer = nn.Linear(
                num_history_encoder_input * history_encoder_channel_dims[-1], history_encoder_final_layer_dim)
            history_encoder_output_activation = activation
            history_encoder_latent_layer = nn.Linear(
                history_encoder_final_layer_dim, num_latent_dims)
            history_encoder_layers.append(nn.Flatten())
            history_encoder_layers.append(history_encoder_output_layer)
            history_encoder_layers.append(history_encoder_output_activation)
            history_encoder_layers.append(history_encoder_latent_layer)
            self.history_encoder = nn.Sequential(*history_encoder_layers)
```

In training, we update the privilege encoder through reinforcement learning and update the history encoder through supervised learning:

```python
            loss = surrogate_loss + self.value_loss_coef * \
                value_loss - self.entropy_coef * entropy_batch.mean()

            # Gradient step
            self.optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(
                self.actor_critic.parameters(), self.max_grad_norm)
            self.optimizer.step()
            
            # history encoder gradient step
            for _ in range(self.num_encoder_epochs):
                if self.actor_critic.history_encoder_type == "TCN":
                    if obs_histories_batch.dim() == 2:
                        # input shape (batch_size, obs_history_len) -> (batch_size, 1, obs_history_len)
                        obs_histories_batch = obs_histories_batch.unsqueeze(1)
                encoder_predictions = self.actor_critic.history_encoder(obs_histories_batch)
                
                with torch.no_grad(): # don't backpropagate through the encoder targets
                    encoder_targets = self.actor_critic.privilege_encoder(privileged_obs_batch)

                encoder_loss = nn.functional.mse_loss( # use mse loss
                    encoder_predictions, encoder_targets)
                self.history_encoder_optimizer.zero_grad()
                encoder_loss.backward()
                self.history_encoder_optimizer.step()
```

## Asymmetric Actor Critic(A2C)

To bridge sim-to-real gap, we usually add noise to the observation of actor. If we give the same observation to the critic, then the critic has to estimate the value from noisy observation, which is difficult. Instead, we can give critic noise-free privilege state obtained from simulation so that it can estimate the value more precisely. This aymmetric actor critic(A2C)$^4$ architecture won't hinder sim-to-real transfer because the critic network will only function in simulation. 

In `go2_ts.py`, we use two buffers for `critic_obs(input of the critic network)` and `privilege_obs(input of the privilege encoder)` separately.

```python

## Ablation of TCN(Temporal Convolutional Network)

In the original teacher-student paper$^1$, authors used TCN as the body of student encoder and compared its computation efficiency with GRU. Here we did an ablation study of TCN to see whether using TCN can bring lower prediction loss and faster training speed. We set history length to 100(corresponds to a history window of 2s). As shown in below two figures, we can see that the total reward is almost the same, but the encoder loss(i.e. prediction loss) of TCN is larger. Meanwhile, the collection_time(time to collect data for one iteration) of both are the same, yet the learning_time(time to update neural networks) of TCN is nearly five times as much as that of MLP.
